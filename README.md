VMCGUI : Versatile Measurement and Control GUI
============
VMCGUI is a PyQt-based Graphical User Interface usable with various measurement and control systems, such as Arduino-based or RaspberryPi-based for example, or homemade ones. Because we are always reprogramming GUIs to plot our data of each system we conceived, we provide here an interface that can be used with any system, without rewriting the source code. For each system you conceive, you'll have to write a little file containing informations of your system, then VMCGUI shall adapt its layer to your needs. The aim of it is to allow acquiring and plotting real-time datas from any measurement and control device(s), by a standard computer. This project describe some ways of using the tool, but the latter have been thought to allow anyone of programming very easily any "kit" under python for desired applications. Then, you can build your own system and connect it to a computer where VMCGUI is running, to plot your measures from the sensors present in the system, and/or control actuators. The main objective of this project is to give an all-in-one solution while enlarging possibilities with measurement and control prototypes, on experimental benches for example.

> DISCLAIMER : This software still a prototype and can encouter some bugs, or programming mistakes. I personnaly encourage python-skilled programmers to try giving more proper versions or letting me know about issues that could be fixed.

Features
-----------

- Adaptative interface to number of sensors and accessible GPIOs.
- Designed to allow very fast sample rate mode.
- Usable without or with any communication protocol from the computer.
- All-in-one solution to correlate control with taken measures.
- Record real-time measurements at sample rate.
- Processing recorded measurements.

How does it work ?
-----------

You basically have a computer, on which runs VMCGUI. Then, you'll have to connect your system to the computer by the way you prefer, which can be almost every way while the used one can be controlled by a python program. For example, by way I mean :
- USB
- VGA
- WiFi
- Ethernet
- Bluetooth
- Jack
- HDMI
- etc...

The only issue is that you'll have to find a way to control your system by the way you choose, through python, if the way you choose haven't been already described in the project resources. This is because, if you create your own measurement and control system, you'll have to write a python file where gonna be the instructions to get the measures and/or controlling the actuators. In short, this python file will make the link between VMCGUI and your system, through the desired communication port. Of course, this project is expected to become a collaborative project, where realised systems can be shared. So you could find ready-to-use systems if one already correspond to your needs.

VMCGUI do not really have limits for number of sensors and number of GPIOs, since the GUI shall adapt its layout depending on the given number of sensors and accessible GPIOs in the python program. As you can see below, here is a standard application for VMCGUI, but you can also put external signals on the GPIOs to control VMCGUI and start a record for example. You can also choose another communication port to communicate with an external GPIO board.

Measurement
---------

Your measurements would basically been took by sensors, with analog or digital output. If it's analog, you'll need to use an ADC to convert measures to numerical values, and send it to the computer through the desired protocol/communication port. But you can also use the built-in ADC of the computer's Jack port for example, if you have only one sensor. Then, measurements gonna be called by the "kit" python program, to get plotted in the VMCGUI.
> You may need to power up your sensor(s). This can be done by a power regulation stage, but you must be very careful that the power can't damage the used computer port, if the communication method isn't wireless.

Control
---------

Here, the control word refer to controlling external devices, or controlling the VMCGUI. In most of cases, controlling things gonna be done by controlling GPIOs. Those GPIOs can be integrated on the acquisition board, or being connected to the computer through another communication method from the one of the acquisition board. Controlling external devices could also be done without GPIOs, by interfacing direcly actuators to the computer, through a serial port for example. Because VMCGUI is an all-in-one solution including measurement and control in a single interface, controlling external devices could be done depending on the measurement values.

----------
Speed rates
----------

Ultimately, VMCGUI is intended to being able to plot datas with a very high time-resolution, up to the fastest existing devices such as 10 GSPS ADC, which means a sample every 0.1 ns. But, for now, since graphs plotted in VMCGUI are using DateAxisItem from the pyqtgraph package, the maximum resolution is the one of timestamp, which is used in the DateAxisItem. The timestamp **maximum resolution is about 1 Âµs**.
Another point is that, when VMCGUI works in a 1-by-1 sample mode, a loop is executed between each sample to plot. This loop is pretty long because python is slow to update each graph, and the travelling data through the communication line can be very slow too. To give an order, this loop has been measured at about 400 ms between each sample with the first version of the [_DualPressure - Thermocouple_](https://github.com/LSDRM/VMCS/tree/88da0f7f0afaeebaeeff0f13b5e0fb5d95d4da9f/Kits/Personnalized/DualPressure%20-%20Thermocouple) kit, which was working in 1-by-1 sample mode. This kit was using an UART protocol with RS485 standard on a 10 meters long communication line between the computer and the acquisition board, using the following devices and parameters :
- a USB to UART bridge chip (FT231XS) ;
- two RS485 transceivers, at both ends of the line (MAX14840) ;
- a 24 bits ADC with a sample rate of 2000 SPS (ADS122U04) ;
- 3 analog sensors ;
- a 9600 baud rate on communication line ;
- for a total of 102 bytes exchanged per loop between the computer and the acquisition board, neglecting the usage of GPIOs integrated to the ADC.

Then, we can calculate that the data exchange on the line contribute for $102\times 8\times 1/9600 = 85\ ms$ per loop theorically. This means that the approximative rest of about 315 ms is due to the execution of pythons instructions. So the lever to improve the speed rate of the system, is to minimizing the number of python instructions per sample update. To perform this, we can consider acquiring multiple samples in a row without asking for each sample, and instead asking for a quantity N of samples. Then, the plot(s) in VMCGUI shall update by bursts of N samples, each separated by the used conversion rate of the ADC. In the figure below, I provide an example of an UART frame from the computer in N-by-N mode (using a USB to UART bridge or other), asking for N samples to the acquisition board. Because there is more than 1 sensor on the acquisition board, the ADC will need to switch from the first to the second sensor. This is usually performed by rewriting a register in the ADC, which need to send another frame to the ADC. Because we don't want to send too much frame from the VMCGUI (which is python-based and slow), we may use a microcontroller between the computer and the ADC, that be in charge of sending those switching sensor frame. In this configuration, the microcontroller must be preprogrammed to understand what it need to do when receiving the frame containing the number N. The preprogramming can be performed on starting VMCGUI in the "kit" python file, or outside VMCGUI using another software (e.g. Arduino IDE for an Arduino-based acquisition board). The used microcontroller can either store all N samples before sending them, or immediatly sending each sample when it acquire it.

----------
Recording measurements and data processing
----------

VMCGUI provide a recording solution to store your measurements in files. Once recorded, you can reopen and plot your datas to generate SVG, matplotlib, CSV,... files and graphs.
> Math operations on plots and between plots in the "Load Data" window are also possible but still in debugging process.

Some examples of use
----------

#### Using an Arduino
The configuration that may be the most used with VMCGUI is probably using an Arduino connected to the computer through USB. This configuration is probably the most simple to set up, because it don't need complex development of special data acquisition board. You'll only need to connect your sensors and actuators to the Arduino as suggested in the doc of the used sensors and actuators, or in the Arduino's documentation if exists. Then, you'll need to talk to the Arduino through python commands, in the "kit" python file of VMCGUI. This can be performed in a very simple way with the _pyfirmata_ library (see https://realpython.com/arduino-python/).

#### Personnalized acquisition board over long distances
Since VMCGUI has been firstly developped for almost long distance application (about 10 meters) and highly noisy environment, the main configuration that has been studied is the following one, using UART communication protocol through RS485 or RS422 standards. This configuration permits to embed the acquisition board on a system with difficult accessibility, through wire connections. The "Data Acquisition IC" could be a microcontroller with ADC, or directly an ADC that have UART communication protocol (e.g. ADS122U04 which include GPIOs).
> Note that in the latter case, with direct connection to an UART ADC, you will not be able to have very fast sample rate with more than one sensor. This is because an ADC will generally need to receive commands to switch its conversion channels between sensors. Then, the N-by-N mode is not possible in this exact configuration.

#### Wireless acquisition board
The previous configuration shows a way to embed acquisition board on systems at long distance or with difficult accessibility. This configuration state of embeding acquisition board on systems with wireless connection to the computer. Development of such a configuration may be a bit trickier but still a possibility for your system if wireless connection is essential.
